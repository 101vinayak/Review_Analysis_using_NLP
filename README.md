# Review_Analysis_using_NLP
Project developed for Analysing Youtube Reviews for a particular poduct using NLP and Neural Networks.

The project is divided in 3 segments:
1. Review model training whereby a model is trained to understand good and bad comments and provide a ranking for the given input/comment on a youtube video.
2. Transcript extraction from the desired product, for eg: Canon Camera. The top 50 pages of youtube are scanned and scraped for the transcripts using the Youtube API.
3. The transcripts are ranked and provided a score. The average score of the complete 'N' video transcripts is used to provide a review score for the product.

Its utilization is huge is recommendation systems, e-commerce websites and many more feedback based customer services.
