 nough cords more selling d5000 series
00:02
has a new camera in its lineup which is
00:05
ad 5600 so let's just get into its
00:08
review so starting off with the build
00:21
quality it has a very sturdy build and
00:23
seem stealthy with the matte black
00:25
finish it is also fairly compact and
00:27
much smaller than all of the DSLRs and
00:30
hence is really easy to hold and take
00:32
around it comes with a 24 megapixel
00:35
aps-c CMOS sensor which is the same one
00:38
found on the D 7200 also there is no a
00:41
air filter which is always nice the
00:48
xenon flash is also built-in which is
00:50
great for taking low-light photos and
00:52
there is a microphone jack for external
00:54
audio as the mic onboard is not very
00:56
amazing this would really improve the
00:59
audio quality of your videos also it
01:02
comes with a standard - as well as a
01:04
two-stage shutter button another thing
01:06
to note is that it's not waterproof or
01:09
weatherproof but all around it's a very
01:11
well-built package and I give a thumbs
01:13
up to Nikon for this quality so speaking
01:20
of the display it's one of the standard
01:22
features of this DSLR as it's a
01:24
rotatable display so it can be rotated
01:27
in any direction to fit a need taking
01:30
shots closer to the ground or some high
01:32
up is made very easy also it can be
01:35
rotated completely which is very great
01:37
for people who film themselves a lot
01:38
especially youtubers also it is a 3.2
01:43
inch touchscreen display which gets
01:45
really bright and as a resolution of
01:48
1:03 7k dots which is more than enough
01:50
the touchscreen display makes it very
01:53
easy to navigate the menu and change
01:55
settings and almost every setting can be
01:57
changed and since on-screen itself it's
02:00
much faster than using a scroll wheel or
02:02
the button also the touch to capture
02:06
replicates what you do on a smartphone
02:09
and can be turned off and used only to
02:12
focus
02:12
speaking of big focus nikon has
02:15
implemented a new AFP technology which
02:17
uses a step-up motor lines pretty silent
02:20
and very accurate and fast it has 39
02:24
focus points out of which nine are
02:26
crossed eyes also we can use the touch
02:29
screen to zoom in and zoom out of photos
02:31
and scroll through entire gallery just
02:34
as we do on our smart phones making it a
02:36
very seamless experience I believe that
02:39
a touchscreen display should be
02:40
implemented on all DSLRs as it's a great
02:43
feature to have coming over to the kit
02:48
lenses this is the 18 to 55 millimeter
02:51
lens which is a kit lens that you would
02:53
get in your box also a telephoto 70 to
02:56
300 millimeter lens can be grabbed with
02:59
the camera for a fraction of its
03:00
original price and that's why I'm
03:02
including it also both lens has a
03:05
vibration reduction and uses the new AFP
03:08
technology that I mentioned earlier also
03:11
another thing to note is that the normal
03:13
lens requires a button to be pressed and
03:15
rotated before being used but overall
03:18
the lenses are really nice talking about
03:27
image quality the Katniss's turned out
03:29
to be sharper than I had expected macros
03:33
are really nice with good background
03:35
blur and photos turned out really nice
03:37
in bright light portraits are good and
03:39
so our landscapes capturing landscapes
03:42
is when you find a quality difference
03:44
between cheap and expensive lenses but
03:47
the photo is plenty sharp and details
03:49
were present even after cropping into
03:51
the photo
03:52
moreover the auto mode really impressed
03:55
me I captured this really fast bird in
03:58
good detail just taking one shot that
04:01
too without any prior thought of
04:02
capturing it which was pretty impressive
04:08
low-light performance was also decent in
04:10
ISO 3200 and 6400 were pretty nice 12800
04:15
was bearable but 25600 had way too much
04:20
noise and I wouldn't recommend using
04:22
talking about the video the video maxes
04:25
out at 1080p 60 frames per second and is
04:28
really good a caveat I found was that
04:30
the full autofocus in video mode was
04:33
slow but we generally use the shutter
04:35
button so that's not a deal-breaker also
04:38
the vibration reduction on the lenses
04:40
was average and it would have been
04:42
better if it was built into the camera
04:44
like the Pentax cameras the time-lapse
04:47
feature is also built into the camera so
04:49
you don't need an external
04:50
intervalometer the camera can also do
04:54
five FPS photo capture which is more
04:56
than enough for the targeted consumers
04:58
but overall it was a good experience
05:01
with this camera and the image quality
05:03
and even the kit lenses speaking of snap
05:06
bridge it was another standout the app
05:09
enables your camera to send photos to
05:11
your phone through the Bluetooth or
05:13
Wi-Fi connection the connection was
05:15
accurate but the battery life shows 100%
05:18
all the time on your phone which is not
05:21
very nice also you can send two
05:24
megapixel compressed photos of the
05:26
original photo but two megapixel
05:28
transfer is faster and also more social
05:30
media friendly so coming to the
05:37
conclusion the one and only complaint
05:39
that I have is the battery life which is
05:41
about 450 shots not a deal-breaker but
05:45
not very good as well
05:46
otherwise the Nikon d50 600 is a very
05:49
capable camera and one of the best in
05:51
the range it is aimed at people who want
05:54
to step up from the beginner camera and
05:56
nicole nailed it with a d50 600
05:59
